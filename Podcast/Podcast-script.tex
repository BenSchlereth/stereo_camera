	\section{Introduction}
	Hi
	My name is Benedikt Schlereth and I'm studying Applied Math and Physics in the sixth Bachelorsemester. 
	Right now I'm working for the Fraunhofer-Institut IIS here in Nuremberg, where we want to find the best feature-extractions tools to detect certain behaviors.
	To learn the practical implementation of new technology I support our local Formula-Student-Team Strohm und Soehne by designing PCB-Boards for the Electric car.
	In the future I also want to contribute helping out in ours Software department.
	
	
	\section{motivation}
	First let me explain what Formula Student is:
	Formula-Student is an international design and construction competition where teams from all around the world are constructing and then racing single seat formula race-cars.
	With the new event of Formula-Student-Driver-less Teams are encouraged to develop their own self-Driving cars.
	My motivation is to kickoff the development of our own Driver-less Vehicle by implementing the first step and providing a way to detect the boundaries of the track.
